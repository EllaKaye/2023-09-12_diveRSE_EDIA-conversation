# A conversation about EDIA in the RSE community: reflections on successes and challenges

Slides for talk at [diveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io) on Sept 12th, 2023.

## Overview

Ella Kaye (Research Software Engineer, University of Warwick) and Malvika Sharan (co-lead of [The Turing Way](http://the-turing-way.netlify.app)) will converse about their experiences in/with the RSE community, as well as both the challenges and successes they've encountered when working to improve EDIA. In a wide-ranging discussion, they will also consider why all RSEs should be engaged with EDIA and how they can offer support, as well as broader philosophical issues around epistemic justice.
